    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The `logging` module is part of the standard Python library and provides tracking for events that occur while software runs. You can add logging calls to your code to indicate what events have happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `logging` module allows for both diagnostic logging that records events related to an application’s operation, as well as audit logging which records the events of a user’s transactions for analysis. It is especially used to record events to a file."

    "## 2. Why use the `logging` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "The `logging` module keeps a record of the events that occur within a program, making it possible to see output related to any of the events that occur throughout the runtime of a piece of software.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be more familiar with checking that events are occurring by using the `print()` statement throughout your code. The `print()` statement does provide a basic way to go about debugging your code to resolve issues. While embedding `print()` statements throughout your code can track the execution flow and the current state of your program, this solution proves to be less maintainable than using the `logging` module for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It becomes difficult to distinguish between debugging output and normal program output because the two are mixed.\n",
    "* When using `print()` statements dispersed throughout code, there is no easy way to disable the ones that provide debugging output.\n",
    "* It becomes difficult to remove all the `print()` statements when you are done with debugging.\n",
    "* There is no log record that contains readily available diagnostic information.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a good idea to get in the habit of using the `logging` module in your code as this is more suitable for applications that grow beyond simple Python scripts and provides a sustainable approach to debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because logs can show you behavior and errors over time, they also can give you a better overall picture of what is going on in your application development process."
